In the area of technological studies, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become an interesting subject matter. It is the interconnection of things with each other over the internet. Average people often assume IoT in terms of self-sustaining vehicles and smart houses; however, some of the most impactful applications of IoT technology are in intensely practical fields.

One such example is the ‘water pollution monitoring system.’ With the growth of the global population and industrialization, water pollution has become a major concern. Using IoT, researchers have developed smart water pollution monitoring systems that ensure reduced time and energy for providing analytical services.

This paper proposes the design of an IoT-based water pollution monitoring system capable of monitoring water quality in real time. The system includes sensors to measure key water quality parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and temperature. These readings are processed using a microcontroller (Arduino) and transmitted to a central controller (NodeMCU) via serial wire communication. NodeMCU then sends the data to an internet server via wireless communication.

Finally, sensor results can be viewed through web browser software or an Android app. The goal is to make this system accessible to rural areas in Bangladesh, addressing the lack of effective water pollution monitoring systems. Remote monitoring and guidance through authenticated data sharing are key objectives of this work.
