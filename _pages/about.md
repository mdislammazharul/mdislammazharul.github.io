Welcome to my portfolio! I am an M.Sc student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de). My academic and professional passions revolve around **Natural Language Processing** and **Deep Learning**, where I enjoy exploring the complexities of language models and cutting-edge AI technologies.

Staying updated with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, such as **GPT**, **BERT** and emerging advancements in areas like **generative AI**, **continual learning**, and efficient **fine-tuning** techniques, **prompt engineering**, fuels my enthusiasm for innovative research and applications. Beyond technical exploration, I love sharing knowledge through blog articles on AI and contributing to the academic community by reviewing research papers.

Feel free to explore my work, and letâ€™s connect to dive deeper into the exciting world of AI and Machine Learning together!
